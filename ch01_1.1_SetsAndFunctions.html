<h2>1.1 Sets and Functions</h2>

<h3>Problem 1</h3>
If $A\cup B = A$ and $A\cap B = A$, then $A = B$.

<br /><br /><i>Proof</i>.<br />
In order to prove that two sets are equal,
we show that $A\subset B$ and $A\supset B$.
<br /><br />
$\subset$). Since $A = A\cap B$ and $A\cap B\subset B$ , then $A \subset B$.
<br /><br />
$\supset$). Since $B \subset A\cup B$ and $A\cup B = A$, then $B\subset A$.
<br /><br />
By inclusion both ways, $A = B$.<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>

<br />

<h3>Problem 2</h3>
Show that in general $(A-B)\cup B \not= A$.
<br /><br />
This can be shown by finding a counterexample. A simple case is when the sets
are disjoint. If we set $A = \{a\}$ and $B = \{b\}$ where $a\not= b$, then
$$
A - B = \{a\} - \{b\} = \{a\} = A.
$$
And then:
$$
(A-B)\cup B = A\cup B = \{a\}\cup\{b\} = \{a,b\} \not= \{a\} = A.
$$

<br />

<h3>Problem 3</h3>
Let $A = \{2, 4, \ldots, 2n, \ldots\}$ and 
$B = \{3, 6, \ldots, 3n, \ldots\}$. Find $A\cap B$ and $A-B$.
<br /><br />
$A$ is the set of all numbers divisible by 2 (even numbers), and $B$ is the set of all numbers
divisible by 3.
<br /><br />
The set $A\cap B$ contains the numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 3. The first
elements will be $\{6, 12, 18, \ldots\}$ so it is clear that it will contain all
numbers divisible by 6.
$$
A\cap B = \{6, 12, 18, \ldots, 6n, \ldots\}.
$$
<br /><br />
The set $A-B$ will contain all even numbers, except those that are divisible by
3. The terms become $\{2, 4, 8, 10, \ldots\}$. We can express this generally
by defining:
$$
g(n) =
\left\{
    \begin{matrix}
    1, & \text{$n$ is odd} \\
    2, & \text{$n$ is even} 
    \end{matrix}
\right.
$$
And so we get:
$$
A - B = \{2, 4, 8, 10, \ldots, 3n - g(n),\ldots \}
$$

<br />

<h3>Problem 4</h3>
Prove that:
<br /><br />
(a) $(A-B)\cap C = (A\cap C)-(B\cap C)$
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Assuming that $x\in (A-B)\cap C$ for some arbitrary $x$. We get the following
equivalent statements.
$$
\begin{aligned}
x\in (A-B)\cap C &\Leftrightarrow x\in A\cap B^c\cap C \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in A\cap B^c\cap C \cap C \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in A\cap C\cap B^c \cap C  \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in A\cap C\;\text{and}\; x\in B^c \cap C \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in A\cap C\;\text{and}\; x\in B^c \;\text{and}\; x\in C \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in A\cap C\;\text{and}\; x\not\in B \;\text{and}\; x\in C \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in A\cap C\;\text{and}\; x\not\in B\cap C\\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in (A\cap C) - (B\cap C)
\end{aligned}
$$
which shows that the statements are equivalent. (Used indempotence and the
commutative property in steps 2 and 3, as well as the definition of set difference).
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
(b) $A\bigtriangleup B = (A\cup B)-(A\cap B)$
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Recall that the symmetric difference is defined in the following way.
$$
A\bigtriangleup B = (A - B)\cup(B - A). 
$$
We will prove this by assuming some arbitrary point $x$ is included in the right
hand side and show that this is equivalent to it being in the left hand side.
To make a step including the distributive property easier to read, we will
define $W = (A\cup B)$.
$$
\begin{align}
x\in (A\cup B)-(A\cap B) &\Leftrightarrow x\in (A\cup B)\cap(A\cap B)^c \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in (A\cup B)\cap(A^c\cup B^c) \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in W\cap(A^c\cup B^c) \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in (W\cap A^c)\cup (W\cap B^c) \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in ((A\cup B)\cap A^c)\cup ((A\cup B)\cap B^c) \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in (A\cap A^c)\cup(B\cap A^c)\cup (A\cap B^c)\cup (B\cap B^c) \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in \emptyset\cup(B\cap A^c)\cup (A\cap B^c)\cup \emptyset \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in (B\cap A^c)\cup (A\cap B^c) \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in (A\cap B^c)\cup (B\cap A^c) \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in (A - B)\cup (B - A) \\
&\Leftrightarrow x\in A\bigtriangleup B 
\end{align}
$$
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<br />

<h3>Problem 5</h3>
Prove that:
$$
\bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha - \bigcup_\alpha B_\alpha \subset
\bigcup_\alpha (A_\alpha - B_\alpha).
$$
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
We just need to prove implications one way.
For some arbitrary point $x$.
$$
\begin{align}
x\in \bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha - \bigcup_\alpha B_\alpha
&\Rightarrow x\in \bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha\cap\Big[\bigcup_\alpha B_\alpha\Big]^c \\
&\Rightarrow x\in \bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha\cap\Big[\bigcap_\alpha B^c_\alpha\Big]  \\
&\Rightarrow x\in \bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha  \;\text{and}\; x\in\bigcap_\alpha B^c_\alpha 
\end{align}
$$
By assumption, there is at least one $\alpha$ such that $x\in A_\alpha$.
Let us fix that index and call it $\beta$. Since
$x\in B_\alpha^c$ for all $\alpha$, we also have $x\in B^c_\beta$.
$$
\begin{align}
x\in A_\beta \;\text{and}\; x\in B_\beta^c
&\Rightarrow x\in A_\beta\cap B_\beta^c \\
&\Rightarrow x\in A_\beta - B_\beta \\
&\Rightarrow x\in \bigcup_\alpha (A_\alpha - B_\alpha)
\end{align}
$$
Since $x$ was some arbitrary point, the inclusion has been proved.
<br /><br />
We will also give a counterexample to show that the reverse inclusion doesn't
need to be true. Define the index set to be $\alpha = \{1, 2\}$. Also, define
the sets:
$$
A_1 = \{1, 2\},\quad B_1 = \{1\}
$$
$$
A_2 = \{1, 2\},\quad B_2 = \{2\}
$$
Using these, we get:
$$
\begin{align}
\bigcup_\alpha (A_\alpha - B_\alpha)
&= (A_1 - B_1) \cup (A_2 - B_2) \\
&= \Big(\{1,2\} - \{1\}\Big) \cup \Big(\{1,2\} - \{2\}\Big) \\
&= \{2\}\cup\{1\} \\
&= \{1, 2\}.
\end{align}
$$
But now, on the left hand side:
$$
\begin{align}
\bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha - \bigcup_\alpha B_\alpha
&= (A_1 \cup A_2) - (B_1 \cup B_2) \\
&= \{1,2\}\cup\{1,2\} - \{1\}\cup\{2\} \\
&= \{1,2\} - \{1,2\} \\
&= \emptyset.
\end{align}
$$
This shows that the reverse inclusion is not necessarily true.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<br />

<h3>Problem 6</h3>
Let $A_n$ be the set of all positive integers divisible by $n$. Find the
sets
$$
\text{(a)}\;\bigcup_{n=2}^\infty A_n
$$
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
The first element of each $A_n$ will be $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
For $2,3$ and any arbitrary $m\in \mathbb{N}$:
$$
A_2 = \{2,\ldots\},\quad A_3 = \{3,\ldots\},\quad
A_m = \{m,\ldots\}
$$
If $m$ is even, the set $A_m$ is already contained in $A_2$, but we are not
concerned with any repetition. For the first two sets:
$$
A_{2,3} = A_2\cup A_3 = \{2, 3, \ldots\},
$$
where
$$
A_{2,m} = \bigcup_{n=2}^m A_n.
$$
After we have joined the first $k$ sets and join $A_{k+1}$:
$$
A_{2,k+1} = A_{2,k}\cup A_{k+1} = \{2,3,\ldots,k,\ldots\}\cup\{k+1,\ldots\}
= \{2,3,\ldots,k,k+1,\ldots\}
$$
where we only add new values when $k+1$ is prime. From this argument it should
be clear that we keep adding in new points until we have filled up the union with
the natural numbers, except for $1$. We define:
$$
\mathbb{N}_2 = \mathbb{N} - \{1\} = \{2,3,4,\ldots\}.
$$
Our claim is that:
$$
\bigcup_{n=2}^\infty A_n = \mathbb{N}_2,
$$
which we prove by showing that they are subsets of each other.
Suppose $m\geq 2$ is some arbitrary natural number.
<br /><br />
$$
\subset)\; m\in \bigcup_{n=2}^\infty A_n
\Longrightarrow
m\in A_m
\Longrightarrow
m\in \mathbb{N}_2
\Longrightarrow
\bigcup_{n=2}^\infty A_n\subset \mathbb{N}_2,
$$
since $m\geq 2$.
$$
\supset)\; m\in \mathbb{N}_2
\Longrightarrow
m\in A_m
\Longrightarrow
m\in \bigcup_{n=2}^\infty A_n
\Longrightarrow
\mathbb{N}_2\subset\bigcup_{n=2}^\infty A_n 
$$
By inclusion both ways, we have shown that
$$
\bigcup_{n=2}^\infty A_n = \mathbb{N}_2.
$$
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
$$
\text{(b)}\;\bigcap_{n=2}^\infty A_n
$$
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
We focus on the first element of the sets again. 
For $2,3$ and any arbitrary $m\in \mathbb{N}$:
$$
A_2 = \{2,\ldots\},\quad A_3 = \{3,\ldots\},\quad
A_m = \{m,\ldots\}
$$
Using a similar definition as earlier:
$$
A_{2,m} = \bigcap_{n=2}^m A_n.
$$
When intersecting $A_2$ and $A_3$, we get:
$$
A_{2,3} = A_2\cap A_3 = \{2,\ldots\}\cap\{3,\ldots\} = \{3,\ldots\}.
$$
After intersecting the first $k$ sets and intersecting that with $A_{k+1}$:
$$
A_{2,k+1} = A_{2,k}\cap A_{k+1} =
\{k,\ldots\}\cap\{k+1,\ldots\} = \{k+1,\ldots\}.
$$
In this case the sets become smaller and smaller, and we will end up with the
empty set. Our claim:
$$
\bigcap_{n=2}^\infty A_n = \emptyset
$$
We prove this by showing that the intersection is empty. Using proof by contradiction,
for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$:
$$
k\in \bigcap_{n=2}^\infty A_n
$$
However, $k$ is not included in the intersection, since $k\not\in A_{k+1}$.
Our assumption cannot be true, and so we must conclude that
$$
\bigcap_{n=2}^\infty A_n = \emptyset.
$$
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<br />

<h3>Problem 7</h3>
Find the following sets.
$$
\text{a)}\;
\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty\Big[a + \frac{1}{n}, b - \frac{1}{n}\Big].
$$
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
To simplify the notation, we will define each interval as:
$$
I_n = \Big[a + \frac{1}{n}, b - \frac{1}{n}\Big].
$$
The first three intervals are:
$$
I_1 = \Big[a + 1, b - 1\Big],\quad
I_2 = \Big[a + \frac{1}{2}, b - \frac{1}{2}\Big],\quad
I_3 = \Big[a + \frac{1}{3}, b - \frac{1}{3}\Big]
$$
As $n$ gets bigger, so do the intervals. Here is a sketch to illustrate:<br /><br /><br />
<img src="img/Kolm_ReAn_1.1_7a.png" />
<br />
By taking the union of the two first sets:
$$
I_1\cup I_2 = I_2
$$
since $I_1\subset I_2$. Since the interval is increasing in size, we also get
$$
\bigcup_{n=1}^{k+1} I_n = I_{k+1}.
$$
Taking the countable union results in the following:
$$
\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty\Big[a + \frac{1}{n}, b - \frac{1}{n}\Big] =
%\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \Big[a + \frac{1}{n}, b - \frac{1}{n}\Big] =
(a, b).
$$
This is from a general property in metric spaces which states that every open
set is a countable union of closed sets.
<br /><br />
For any $\varepsilon > 0$, $a+\varepsilon\in \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$
since we can find some $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $a+1/N < a + \varepsilon$,
so $a\not\in I_n$ for all $n$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
$$
\text{b)}\;
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\Big(a - \frac{1}{n}, b + \frac{1}{n}\Big).
$$
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
We will denote each interval as $I_n$. The first three intervals are:
$$
I_1 = \Big(a - 1, b + 1\Big),\quad
I_2 = \Big(a - \frac{1}{2}, b + \frac{1}{2}\Big),\quad
I_3 = \Big(a - \frac{1}{3}, b + \frac{1}{3}\Big)
$$
Here is a sketch to illustrate:<br /><br /><br />
<img src="img/Kolm_ReAn_1.1_7b.png" />
<br /><br />
As the sets, or intervals, are decreasing and since $I_1 \subset I_2$,
we get:
$$
I_1\cap I_2 = I_2,
$$
and in general,
$$
I_1\cap I_2\cap\ldots\cap I_k\cap I_{k+1} = I_{k+1}.
$$
Taking an infinite amount of intersections gives:
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\Big(a - \frac{1}{n}, b + \frac{1}{n}\Big) =
[a, b].
$$
This is from a general property in metric spaces which states that every closed
set is a countable intersection of open sets.
<br /><br />
For any $\varepsilon > 0$, $a-\varepsilon\not\in \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$
since we can find some $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $a-\varepsilon\not\in I_N$,
but $a\in I_n$ for all $n$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<br />

<h3>Problem 8</h3>
Let $A_\alpha$ be the set of points on the curve
$$
y = \frac{1}{x^\alpha},\;\;0< x <\infty.
$$
We will determine the intersection:
$$
\bigcap_{\alpha\geq 1} A_\alpha.
$$
Sketching the graphs for $\alpha = 1,\ldots, 6$, which gives us a hint to the solution.
<br /><br /><br />
<img src="img/Kolm_ReAn_1.1_8.png" />
<br /><br />
Expressing the set explicitly; $A_\alpha = \{(x, 1/x^\alpha)\;|\; x > 0\}$, so each element contains a
point corresponding to the cartesian coordinates. The first two sets are:
$$
A_1 =  \{(x, 1/x)\;|\; x > 0\}
$$
$$
A_2 =  \{(x, 1/x^2)\;|\; x > 0\}
$$
When considering the intersection $A_1\cap A_2$, we need to find all points $(x, y)$ that are in
both $A_1$ and $A_2$, which amounts to finding all $x\in\R$ with $x>0$ such that
$$
\frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{x^2}
\;\Longrightarrow\;
x^2 = x
\;\Longrightarrow\;
x = 1.
$$
So we can conclude that $(1,1)\in A_1\cap A_2$.
Furthermore, this solution is unique, so $A_1\cap A_2 = \{(1, 1)\}$.
<br /><br />
For any arbitrary $k\in\N$, we get for $x=1$:
$$
\frac{1}{1^k} = 1
$$
so $(1,1)\in A_k$. We can therefore conclude that
$$
\bigcap_{\alpha\geq 1} A_\alpha = \{(1, 1)\}.
$$

<br />

<h3>Problem 9</h3>
Let $y = f(x) = \langle x\rangle$ for all real $x$, where $\langle x\rangle$ is the fractional part
of $x$, i.e $x = 3.635$ means $\langle x\rangle = 0.635$ and
$x = -2.6$ means $\langle x\rangle = 0.6$.<br /><br />
<b>Claim</b>: Every closed interval of length 1 has the same image under $f$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Suppose $a$ and $b$ are two arbitrary, real numbers. We will consider the closed intervals
$D_1 = [a, a+1]$ and $D_2 = [b, b+1]$. We want to prove that $f(D_1) = f(D_2)$, i.e. show that
these sets are included in each other
<br /><br />
$\subset)$. Assume $x\in f(D_1)$. Since this is the fractional part, $x = 0.d_1d_2d_3\ldots$
where $d_i$ is some integer between 1 and 9 for each $i$. Since $D_2$ is an interval of length
1, there will be some $z\in D_2$ such that $z = c.d_1d_2d_3\ldots$, but then
$f(z) = 0.d_1d_2d_3\ldots = x\in f(D_2)$ which shows that $f(D_1)\subset f(D_2)$.
<br /><br />
$\supset)$. By assuming $x\in f(D_2)$ and using the exact same argument as above, we can show that
$f(D_2)\subset f(D_1)$.
<br /><br />
By inclusion both ways, $f(D_1) = f(D_2)$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
The image of $f$ is $[0,1)$. For any integer $p\in\Z$, we will get $f(p) = 0$ and the rest of the
interval is filled with all values that are not integers.
<br /><br />
The function $f$ is NOT one-to-one. Counter examples are $1.5$ and $2.5$ that both map to $0.5$
which violates the injective property, so we cannot have a bijection and so $f$ is not one-to-one.
<br /><br />
The preimage of $1/4\leq y\leq 3/4$ will be the closed intervals:
$$
\ldots, [-1.75, -1.25], [-0.75, -0.25], [0.25, 0.75], [1.25, 1.75], [2.25, 2.75], \ldots
$$
Or, more generally:
$$
\Big\{[p+0.25, p+0.75]\;\big|\; p\in\Z\Big\}.
$$
We can find a partition (a collection of pairwise disjoint subsets of $\R$) by defining
the following half-closed intervals:
$$
\Big\{[p, p+1)\;\big|\; p\in\Z\Big\}.
$$

<br />

<h3>Problem 10</h3>
Given a set $M$ and let $\mathscr{R}$ be the set of all ordered pairs on the form $(a,a)$
with $a\in M$. Let $aRb$ iff $(a,b)\in\mathscr{R}$. Interpreting the relation $R$.
<br /><br />
Since $(a,b)\in\mathscr{R}$, this means that $b = a$, which again means that $aRb$ is $a=b$.
The relation is simply equality.
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br />
Before going to the next problem. Recall the three properties of an equivalence relation
$R$ defined on some set $M$. 
<ul>
    <li><i>Reflexivity</i>: $aRa$ for every $a\in M$.</li>
    <li><i>Symmetry</i>: If $aRb$ then $bRa$</li>
    <li><i>Transitivity</i>: If $aRb$ and $bRc$, then $aRc$</li>
</ul>

<br />

<h3>Problem 11</h3>
Example of binary relations that do not satisfy all properties.
<br /><br />
(a). Reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive.
<br /><br />
Going out of the realm of mathematics and applying this to family relations.
If we define $B$ as being blood relative (common grandparents), then
$aBa$ is true for a person $a$. If $b$ is a cousin or sibling, then $aBb$ implies $bBa$ and vice versa.
If $c$ is a cousin of $b$, and $b$ a cousin of $a$, then $aBb$ and $bBc$ holds, but not necessarily $aBc$.
So the blood relation $B$ is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive.
<br /><br />
(b). Reflexive, but neither symmetric nor transitive.
<br /><br />
Let $M$ be all humans, and define the relation $K$ which means to know someone's name.
If we disregard people with amnesia etc. then all people know their own name, so $aKa$
is satisfied. If $aKb$ it is not always the case that $bKa$,
so this relation is not symmetric. (For instance if $b$ is a celebrity). It is not
transitive, for $aKb$ and $bKc$ does not mean $aKc$. It is not always the case that person $a$
knows everyone $b$ knows. In summary, the $K$ relation is reflexive, but not symmetric and not transitive.
<br /><br />
(c). Symmetric, but neither reflexive nor transitive.
<br /><br />
Again, let $M$ be all humans and let $R$ mean to be in a romantic relationship.
A person $a$ cannot be in a romantic relationship with himself/herself, so $aRa$ is not possible.
If $aRb$ then $bRa$ (disregarding some of the complexity of the human psyche here), which means
the relation is symmetric. If $aRb$ and $bRc$ it is not always the case that $aRc$, such as in
the case when $b$ is unfaithful to $a$. So transitivity is not satisfied.
<br /><br />
(d). Transitive, but neither reflexive nor symmetric.
<br /><br />
This is achieved with the strictly greater than operator. For some $a,b,c\in\R$,
then it is not reflexive since $a < a$ is not true. And if $a < b$, then
$b > a$ cannot be true. But if $a < b$ and $b < c$, then $a < c$ holds.
The $<$ operator is not reflexive, not symmetric, but it is transitive.
